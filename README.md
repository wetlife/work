##Notes
- first and only prority until it's finished: get computer computing required actions only for base use cases
- address the quantification of qualitative data
-- any functional mapping is fine as a first guess at something which gives some correlation between report card scores and the property-value of interest so long as there is indeed a correlation between the report card's score and the property-value of interest.
- as soon as there is a working computation, I can have input into the exciting task of optimizing the measurement of the property value of interest
