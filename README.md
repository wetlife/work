## Kirsten's FEGS Report Card Paper Notes
- first and only prority until it's finished: get computer computing required actions only for base use cases
- address the quantification of qualitative data
  * any functional mapping is fine as a first guess at something which gives some correlation between report card scores and the property-value of interest so long as there is indeed a correlation between the report card's score and the property-value of interest.
- as soon as there is a working computation, I can have input into the exciting task of optimizing the measurement of the property values of interest
- in all basic flows, that is for each case-study, I am unclear whether most items are instructions to users that should be completed in consideration before use of the tool or whether the item in question is an instruction for the desired use of the software including user input of data into software. Perhaps the software is to complete some items with the needed input from users? Examples of unclear items follow. These items are from "Basic Flow" in "Use Case #3: Lake Eerie"
  * "Task 2: Identify benefits of of ecosystem services;"
  * "Task 2a: translate banafits into twems for identifying users/beneficiaries"
  * "Task 3: Identify beneficiaries or users."
- hold whiteboard session for first scrum on Monday
  * create flowchart for required functions
  * place desired features, functions, extensensibility, scalability in distinct format attached to flowchart of requirements
  * in order to produce a usable prototype, I need to fully unnderstand Kirsten's desired outcome of my first scrum, which I hope will yield a functioning tool!
